                <p id=BTA-desc>
                    As a CRM Analyst I produce reports to monitor key KPIs and produce customer segments for targeted marketing campaigns with a particular focus on developing automated processes to allow for more efficient reporting. <br><br>

                    I have been an active participant in a replatform of our CRM system to Salesforce Core and Marketing Cloud with responsibilities revolving around data verification (e.g. customer data, transactional data, product data), assisting with the refinement of ETL processes (daily delta flows and migration processes), and implementing automated solutions to resolve any data discrepancies. Since the replatform, I have been an admin of our Salesforce Core and Marketing Cloud instances.<br><br>

                    Some of my key achievements in this role to date include:</p>

                <p id=EY-Desc>

                    As a member of the TAXapps Data Analytics team in EY, I am responsible for the automation of tax processes for clients. Using a wide range of range software and programming languages (including Python, SQL, VBA, Alteryx, HTML, Javascript, PowerBI, and Tableau) I develop solutions which allow clients to gain insight into their tax spending and create software which allows clients to automate their existing processes (e.g. tax compliance reporting).<br><br>

                    Some of my key projects and achievements in this position to date include:</p>
                <ul id='EY-achiev'>
                    <!--List source: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists.asp -->
                    <li class='exp-li'> Being nominated for and winning two EY Impact awards - one for maintaining a consistently high level of performance, the second for "Building a Better Working World" due to my contribution to the TAXapps team (and developing a team newsletter).
                    <li class='exp-li'> I was the lead backend developer in the Connected Tax Transformation project. In this project, we aimed to develop a Django-based web application which would allow tax professionals to fully automate tax reporting for any client by creating a standard solution to extract client accounting data, classify transactions as tax allowable or disallowable using a machine learning algorithm which we developed, develop a streamlined review process, create visualisations of the client's tax liability, and automatically generate a CT1.
                        <br><br>
                        In this project, I had responsibilities over the database architecture underlying our website, the automation of the generation of the CT1, developing view methods using a combination of pandas, pyodbc, and SQL to allow data to flow appropriately through the database tables, and working with tax professionals to develop demonstrations to present our project.
                    </li>
                    <li class='exp-li'> The development of a solution which automatically extracted data from a client's tax computation report, transformed it into a flat file structure, and populated a database which was linked to a Tableau visualisation which we developed allowed the client to gain immediate insight into their tax liability.
                    </li>
